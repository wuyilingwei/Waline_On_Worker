## Configuration Priority

> **All secrets follow the same rule: environment variable / `wrangler secret` always takes precedence over the admin UI panel.**
>
> Set a value in the panel for convenience; override it server-side with a secret when you need it locked down. The server-side value wins unconditionally.

## Anti-Spam Configuration

Waline on Worker supports four spam-detection modes, selectable from the Worker Settings page:

| Mode | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| **Off** | No spam detection |
| **Akismet** | Uses the Akismet service only |
| **LLM** | Uses an OpenAI-compatible LLM API only |
| **Mix** | Both Akismet and LLM run in parallel; a comment is marked spam if either flags it |

### Akismet Key Placement

The Akismet API key supports **two placement methods** — the environment variable always takes precedence:

1. **Environment variable (recommended for production)** — stored as a Worker secret, never exposed to the frontend:
   ```bash
   wrangler secret put AKISMET_KEY
   ```

2. **Admin UI** — set the key directly on the Worker Settings page (`/ui/worker-setting`). Convenient for quick setup; stored encrypted in D1. The UI value is used only when `AKISMET_KEY` is not set as a secret.

This dual-placement design means you can manage the key however fits your workflow without changing code.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lsy-404/Waline_On_Worker.git
cd Waline_On_Worker
pnpm install

# Create D1 database and edit wrangler.toml
npx wrangler d1 create waline-db
pnpm run db:init
npx wrangler secret put JWT_SECRET
pnpm run deploy
```

Please refer to the [documentation](docs/README.md) for detailed deployment steps and configuration instructions.

<summary><strong>What's New</strong></summary>

### v1.1.0

- **Fix: OAuth social account binding** — Logging in with a social provider while already signed in now correctly links the social account to the existing password-based account instead of creating a duplicate. Conflicts (social ID already bound to another account) return a clear `oauth_already_bound` error.
- **Akismet anti-spam** — Native Akismet integration alongside the existing LLM reviewer. Admins choose one of four modes (Off / Akismet / LLM / Mix) from the settings page. The Akismet key can be placed as a `wrangler secret` (server-side, higher priority) or entered directly in the admin UI (stored in D1).
- **Unified spam review pipeline** — Internal refactor consolidates all spam-detection paths into a single `runSpamReview()` function, eliminating redundant DB reads and making future detectors easy to add.
- **Settings batch reads** — All settings lookups in the comment POST path are now a single `getSettings()` batch call instead of multiple sequential `getSetting()` calls.
